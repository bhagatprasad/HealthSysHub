[33m38cd53c[m[33m ([m[1;31morigin/Feature/Create_Manage_Staff[m[33m)[m If you want to avoid creating separate tables for each role (e.g., Doctor, Nurse, Lab Technician, etc.) and instead handle everything in a **single table**, you can use a **generic design** that accommodates all staff members in one table. This approach simplifies the schema and makes it easier to manage, but it requires careful design to ensure flexibility and maintainability.
